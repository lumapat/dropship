Organize and safeguard files in your system.

## TODO

- [X] Support overwriting sync (flat out copying one directory to another)
- [X] Support missing-only sync (do not delete, only copy between directories)
- [ ] Create organize sub-command to organize files by some criteria (initially by parent directory and date)
